# Pixel Bakery Pachinko Game

## Overview

This game is my first 2D project created using Unity, developed in just one day. The game features a **Pachinko-style** gameplay where you control a **Golden Cinnamon Roll** and navigate through a variety of delicious obstacles, trying to land on different types of cakes for points. It is a fun and fast-paced arcade-style game with bouncing and spinning obstacles that add excitement to the experience.

## Gameplay

- The game begins at the top where you control a **Golden Cinnamon Roll**.
- Player is given 300 initial points and every drop costs 100. 
- **Movement**: Use **A** or **D** (or the arrow keys) to move left and right to choose where to drop the cinnamon roll.
- **Dropping**: Once you've positioned yourself, press the **Spacebar** to drop the cinnamon roll and let the fun begin!

### Obstacles:
- **Clover Cookies**: These are spinning obstacles that will block your path.
- **Donut Cookies**: These are also spinning obstacles, but slightly different in appearance and behavior.
- **Fluffy Pancakes**: These bounce you away when hit, providing an additional challenge.
- **Wall Bouncing**: You can bounce off the walls, which adds more unpredictability and fun to the gameplay.

### Collectable:
- **Coffee**: This special collectable is worth **1500 points**.  Everyone needs a little coffee in life :D
- It spawns only after the previous Coffee has been collected, adding an extra layer of challenge and reward!

### Scoring System:
- **Strawberry Shortcake**: 500 points
- **Raspberry Cake**: 200 points
- **Matcha Cake**: 100 points
- **Vanilla Cake**: 80 points

Try to land on the cakes for the highest score possible while avoiding the obstacles!
